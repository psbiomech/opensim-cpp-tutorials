# opensim-cpp-tutorials
Prasanna Sritharan, July 2018

This is just me getting to grips with the OpenSim API through the developer tutorials on the OpenSim website [here](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu/display/OpenSim/Developer%27s+Guide).

My versions of the code typically differ from the online solutions as I prefer to implement the main function, new classes and additional functions in separate cpp and header files, and also prefer to avoid use of global variables. The online solutions tend to use global variables and implement new classes in the same file as the main function, which is not best practice.
